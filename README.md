# Lightshot scraper

**For educational purposes only**!<br>
The website LightShot or prnt.sc is a public image sharing website which is most well known for its quick and easy downloadable sharing utility activated by pressing the PrtScn key. 
It's a very useful tool, however it stores images based on a sequential 6 digit code, meaning the 1.3 billion or so images uploaded there can be indexed programmatically quite easily.
That is what this utility does.

## Usage
- ```-n``` Number of pictures to scrape (default 10)
- ```-o``` The path where images will be stored (default "pics")
